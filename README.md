[Homework Submission](http://bootcampspot-v2.com)

# Solving Problems:
* 1. Define the problem
* 2. Break the problem down into different parts
* 3. solve for the different parts with pseudo code
* 4. If you donâ€™t know the tools to solve the sub problems, research it
* 5. Incrementally solve for each pseudo-coded solution using actual code and test it out

Daily Reminder:
- Network A lot!
- Live Office Hours: 45 minutes before class and 30 minutes after class
- Office hours with TA's can be scheduled for 30 minutes if by appointment. Otherwise, the max time is 15 minutes per session (due to need from other students)
- 1:1 bi-weekly meetings with instructor are mandatory.
  - [Calendly Link](https://calendly.com/omarpatel123)
- Please follow the following process when asking a question:
  1. Did I think about the problem myself?
  2. Did I check Google? Does the query match my problem?
    - [How to Google](https://realworldcoding.io/how-to-google-programming-problems-effectively-90f2a43ef982)
  3. Did I ask others in the Slack channel?
  - If all of the others are fulfilled, you can then ask instructional staff for help on a technical issue. For non-technical issues, please ping JP on Slack.

# Class Repo Updating SOP

> Use this every week to save last week's work in that week's branch (i.e. `week-2`) and pull in the new week's material

1. Open Terminal/Git Bash and `cd` into the class repository's folder (likely called `UCLAWES201808FSF3` if you didn't change it)

2. Check to see what `branch` you're in by typing `git branch -a`, you should be in the previous week's branch. (i.e. If you're starting `week-3`, your branch would probably be `week-2`)

3. Save the work you did the prior week by doing a `git add -A` and `git commit -m "saving work"`

4. Now you'll want to get back into your `master` branch by typing in `git checkout master`.

5. When in the `master` branch, do a `git pull origin master` to get all of the updated content for the week.

6. Since you don't want to actively be doing work in `master`, let's create a copy of it by typing `git checkout -b week-3` (week-3 is an example of whatever week we're entering)

7. Type in `git branch -a` to check what branch you are currently in, you should be in that newly created one from `step 6`.

8. You're all good! You now have a working branch to do all of the class activities for the week without worrying about it being overwritten next time you pull down new content.
